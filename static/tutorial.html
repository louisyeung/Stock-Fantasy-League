                        <p>We aim to provide a tutorial that caters to various audiences: beginners learning about stock trading and markets for the first time and to experienced traders already familiar with the market. We intend to have a fully working visual, an interactive tutorial on our website that walks through the various steps in stock trading; in particular, the interactive tutorial will have sample stock data that can be inspected as if it were real data seen in-game/league. Furthermore, we also plan to provide a second tutorial describing the process of how to use the application and its functionalities. As of right now we have outlined the different components that users will see in the final tutorial.&nbsp;
                            <br></p>
                        <p>The tutorial about stock trading itself is intended to be interactive, while the second tutorial describing usage of the application may either be interactive or instruction based with clearly labeled pictures presented in an easy-to-read format.
                            <br></p>
                        <h2>Let's begin...</h2>
                        <p> Once logged into the website, the new user has instantly created a user profile! The user account is automatically linked to the user's Google account, so username and default picture are already chosen. Now the user can get started with gameplay by creating/joining a league. &nbsp;<br></p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Every league will have a corresponding leaderboard that orders players within a league based on the number of reputation points accumulated. This additional feature gives players an extra incentive when actively competing against each other. <br></p>

                        <p>After joining a league within the Leagues page, you will be placed into a stock market trading interface, where you can visually see data for some company. The contents of this data include but are not limited to: Company Name, Current Price, Volume, and other information. Furthermore, a graphical representation of the stock data of that company over the past week will be provided. In addition to the basic functionalitites described above, users will be able to access a variety of useful stock market tools provided on the toolbar.<br></p>

                        <p>The RSS feed will distribute a list of headlines related to Stock Fantasy League and inform users on Stock Market League in an organized, easy-to-read fashion.
